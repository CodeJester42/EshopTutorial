<h2>About The Project</h2>
  
<p>This project involves the replication of a responsive website utilizing ReactJS and Tailwind CSS that was recorded and uploaded onto Youtube. This type of video helps me learn much easier as I do best when lead by example. Seeing how the person executes the code and the process of building the website was straight forward, the code was also easy to read.</p>

<h2>Product Name - ESHOP</h2>

<h2>Built With</h2>
<li>Vite</li>
<li>React</li>

<h2>What I've learned from this tutorial:</h2>
<li>How the light/dark mode feature is implemented.</li>
<li>pngtree.com</li>


<h2>What I've enjoyed about this tutorial:</h2>
<p>Mainly because it showed me how the light/dark mode feature is coded and implemented onto a website. I've also enjoyed learning how to use stock photos (pngtree.com)
and use them for making it presentable.</p>
